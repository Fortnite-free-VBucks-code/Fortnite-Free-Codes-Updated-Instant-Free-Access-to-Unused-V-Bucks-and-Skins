## How Fortnite Codes Work

Fortnite codes are alphanumeric strings that can be redeemed in-game or through the Epic Games website for various rewards. These codes typically unlock cosmetic items such as skins, emotes, sprays, and more. In some cases, you may even be able to get V-Bucks, which are Fortnite’s in-game currency used to purchase additional items.

Fortnite codes come in different types, such as:
- **V-Bucks Codes:** These unlock Fortnite's premium currency, V-Bucks, that can be used to purchase skins, battle passes, and other in-game items.
- **Skin Codes:** These codes unlock special skins or character outfits, which are cosmetic items that alter the appearance of your character in-game.
- **Battle Pass Codes:** Sometimes, Fortnite offers codes that unlock the Battle Pass, which allows players to earn exclusive rewards through leveling up during a season.
- **Event or Promotional Codes:** Fortnite regularly partners with brands, games, and franchises, offering special codes for limited-time promotions or events.

These codes are generally distributed through partnerships, giveaways, promotions, or events organized by Epic Games or its partners.

## How to Redeem Fortnite Codes
To redeem Fortnite codes, follow these steps:
1. **Go to the Fortnite website:** Visit the official Epic Games website or open the Fortnite app on your console or PC.
2. **Log in to your Epic Games account:** Make sure you’re signed into your Fortnite account before attempting to redeem a code.
3. **Navigate to the “Redeem Code” section:** On the Epic Games website, go to the Fortnite page and look for the “Redeem Code” section. On your console or PC, this option will typically be in the settings or main menu of Fortnite.
4. **Enter the Code:** Type in the code exactly as it appears, paying attention to capitalization and numbers.
5. **Confirm the Redemption:** Once you've entered the code, confirm it, and the corresponding reward will be added to your account.

## The Search for Free Fortnite Codes
Players looking for free Fortnite codes often seek out new, unused codes. Some reliable sources include:
